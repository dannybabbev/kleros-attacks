/**
 * @title Attack on early reveal by deposit
 * @author Cl√©ment Lesaege - <clement@lesaege.com>
 * Based on a simplification of the cut and chose attack by Zack Lawrence.
 *  
 * 
 * The attacker can give insight to its choice in an early reveal penalization scheme.
 * (See Truthcoin whitepaper article IV (f): http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/truthcoin-whitepaper.pdf)
 * The attacker put a deposit in the contract, this deposit will only be reimburse if the attacker votes as it promized to the contract.
 * This let other parties to that either:
 *  -The attacker voted/will vote as it promized.
 *  OR
 *  -The attacker will lose its deposit.
 * 
 * 
 * Scheme against early reveal:
 * During the commitment phase, parties commit to a value by submitting hashedValue=hash(value,salt) where salt is a random value.
 * During the reveal phase, parties can submit (value,salt), the contract verifies that hash(value,salt) corresponds to the submission.
 * If it does, it accepts value.
 * 
 * Before the reveal phase anyone can submit the (value,salt) of another party to penalize it.
 * This way parties are incentivized to not reveal their (value,salt) (they can reveal value, but there no reason to believe a party which just revealed value).
 * 
 * 
 * To attack this scheme and let other parties know value, the attacker submits (hashedValue,value) and pays a deposit d while creating this contract.
 * After the reveal phase starts, the attacker can submit salt to this contract. If hash(value,salt) corresponds to hashedValue, this contract gives back the attacker deposit.
 * If the attacker made a false promize, the deposit stays stucked forever in this contract.
